\section{Brief Description}

We're building an attendance system to make life easier for both teachers and students. It lets teachers kick off classes right away and handle attendance in the first 10 minutes without stopping the lecture. The system shows a QR code on the screen for the first 10 minutes using the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) feature in browsers. After 10 minutes, the QR code goes away.

Students scan this QR code to mark themselves as here. To stop any cheating, like students sending the QR code to friends, we're adding two cool things:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Geolocation} - When students scan the QR code, the system checks their location. They need to be in class, or it won't count.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic QR} - The QR code changes every few seconds. So, if you try to send it to a friend, it'll be useless real fast.
\end{enumerate}

The system has a dashboard for the teachers to view the attendance rate and many more data.
